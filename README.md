## Summary
I am an applied research scientist and an ex-software engineer with a decade of experience in research and development. My background ranges from machine learning, network science, scalable data mining, and predictive modeling. I have pioneered several novel computational tools to model and analyze graph-based spreading processes. During my Ph.D. and postdoc, I developed expertise in end-to-end solutions leveraging real-world data.
